Example :

(A | !B) + (C ^ D + E) => F
F => G + H

FIRST LINE :

Parenthesis priority
Not priority
Declare !1
Declare B
!1 -> B
Replace
(A | !B) + (C ^ D + E) => F
With
(A | !1) + (C ^ D + E) => F



Or priority
Declare |1
Declare A
|1 -> A
|1 -> !1
Replace
(A | !1) + (C ^ D + E) => F
With
|1 + (C ^ D + E) => F



Parenthesis priority
Scope DOWN
And priority
Declare &1
Declare D
Declare E
&1 -> D
&1 -> E
Replace
|1 + (C ^ D + E) => F
With
|1 + (C ^ &1) => F



Xor priority
Declare ^1
Declare C
^1 -> C
^1 -> &1
Replace
|1 + (C ^ &1) => F
With
|1 + ^1 => F



And priority
Declare &2
&2 -> |1
&2 -> ^1
Replace
|1 + ^1 => F
With
&2 => F

What implies done

Implies what ?

Declare F 				// If there is an OR statement prompt, if AND statement see below
F -> &2					// make "implied" variable points to last rule node added







SECOND LINE

F

What implies done

Implies what ?

Declare G				// just make all "implied" variables point to last rule node added
Declare H
G -> F					// make "implied" variable points to last rule node added
H -> F					// make "implied" variable points to last rule node added
